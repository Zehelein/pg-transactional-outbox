# Transactional Outbox Inbox Setup

This project provides a CLI which generates the SQL scripts to set up the
transactional inbox and/or the transactional outbox data structures for the
logical replication or polling listener variants.

Run `yarn` to install the dependencies and then `yarn dev:watch` to start the
CLI which will guide you through the steps.
